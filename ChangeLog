	[dialplan] fix locating attributes with number values.
	If the array of attributes contains numberical keys like, the strpos fails. According to docs -> if needle is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the ordinal value of a character.
	Reported by Flavio Goncalves.
	Example of failing configuration:

	$config->attrs_cb=array(
	                 // name , description
	                "3" => "usrloc",
	                "4" => "pstn",
	                "5" => "media",
	         );
	Note the numerical keys!

	cdrviewer: handle large amounts of exported CDRs
	When a large number of CDRs are exported, apache would crash due to
	memory exhaustion, or execution timeout. This commit improves the
	exporter's behavior by:
	 * fetching the CDRs row by row, lowering the memory usage
	 * disable query buffering, to ensure release after a new row is fetched
	 * add behavior of setting a custom execution time, by configuring the
	   `$cdr_export_time_limit` variable

		SELECT DISTINCT callid FROM sip_trace WHERE status='' AND

		ERROR 3065 (HY000): Expression #1 of ORDER BY clause is not in
		    SELECT list, references column 'opensips.sip_trace.id' which
		    is not in SELECT list; this is incompatible with DISTINCT

	    * be consistent across different backends (e.g. don't sort the

	boxes iteration: Change the for loop to a foreach
	The for loop was assuming that the user was using array keys
	sequentially in the boxes array.  While this would normally be the case,
	the example code encourages you to skip a key as the example for
	'Presence Server' used a commented out key of '1' - the symptom here was
	that the mi_connectors array was not built correctly.
